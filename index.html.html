            <h2>Who I Am & Why I'm Here</h2>
            <p>Hey there! I'm a 16-year-old student who's absolutely fascinated by the world of finance and investing. While most people my age are figuring out their next video game purchase, I'm reading annual reports and trying to understand what makes businesses tick.</p>
            
            <p>I won't pretend I'm Warren Buffett or some investing genius. I'm not. I'm a teenager who's learning, making mistakes, asking questions, and documenting everything along the way. This blog is my journal, my classroom, and hopefully, a place where others who are curious about finance can learn alongside me.</p>

            <p>What drives me? It's this deep hunger to understand how money works, how businesses grow, and how ordinary people can build wealth over time. I believe financial literacy is one of the most important skills anyone can have, and I'm determined to master it while I'm young enough to let compound interest work its magic for decades.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. The same goes for learning about investing."
            </div>

            <p>I write this blog with respect for those who've been in the markets for decades and humility about how much I still don't know. Every post here represents hours of research, reading, and thinking. I fact-check everything, cite my sources, and I'm not afraid to say "I don't know" when that's the honest answer.</p>

            <p>My goal isn't to give you financial advice (I'm 16, after all, and not a financial advisor). My goal is to share what I'm learning, break down complex topics into understandable pieces, and create a resource that I wish existed when I first got curious about investing.</p>

                <h3>Understanding Compound Interest: Why Einstein Called It the Eighth Wonder</h3>
                <div class="post-meta">Posted on February 8, 2026 | 8-minute read</div>
                
                <p>When I first heard about compound interest, I thought it sounded too good to be true. Money making money? That makes more money? It felt like some kind of financial fairy tale. But after running the numbers myself and really understanding the math, I realized why starting young is such a massive advantage.</p>

                <p>Let me break this down the way I wish someone had explained it to me. Imagine you invest $1,000 today and it earns 8% annually. After one year, you have $1,080. That's simple enough. But here's where it gets interesting: in year two, you earn 8% not just on your original $1,000, but on the full $1,080. You earn <span class="highlight">interest on your interest</span>.</p>

                <p>This might seem like a small difference at first. And honestly? It is. The first few years of compound interest are pretty underwhelming. But time is the secret ingredient. After 10 years at 8%, that $1,000 becomes $2,159. After 20 years? $4,661. After 40 years? $21,724. That's not a typo. The same $1,000, with no additional contributions, grows more than 21 times over.</p>

                <p>This is why I'm so passionate about learning about investing at 16. Every year I wait is a year I lose that exponential growth. If I can learn to make smart financial decisions now and start investing even small amounts in my late teens and early twenties, I'm giving myself a 40 or 50-year runway for compound interest to work.</p>

                <div class="quote-box">
                    "Understanding compound interest changed how I think about every dollar. It's not just what I can buy today, it's what that dollar could become over time."
                </div>

                <p>The flip side of this? Compound interest works against you too. Credit card debt at 20% interest compounds in the opposite direction. That's why understanding this concept isn't just about getting rich, it's about avoiding the mistakes that keep people broke.</p>

                <p>I've been using online compound interest calculators to run different scenarios. What if I could invest $100 a month starting at 18? What about $200? What if I get started at 25 instead of 20? The numbers tell a clear story: time matters more than almost anything else. A person who invests $200 a month from age 25 to 35 and then stops will end up with less at 65 than someone who invests $200 a month from 35 to 65. Same total amount invested, wildly different results.</p>

                <p>I'm still learning the best ways to actually invest (index funds, individual stocks, bonds, real estate, there's so much to explore), but I already know that understanding compound interest is foundational. It's the math that makes everything else make sense.</p>

                <h3>My First Dive Into Financial Statements: Annual Reports Aren't as Scary as They Look</h3>
                <div class="post-meta">Posted on February 1, 2026 | 10-minute read</div>
                
                <p>I remember the first time I downloaded an annual report from a company's investor relations page. It was 150 pages long. I opened it, saw a wall of numbers and legal jargon, and immediately thought, "There's no way I can understand this."</p>

                <p>But here's what I've learned over the past few months: you don't need to understand every single page. You don't even need to read them in order. Once you know what you're looking for, annual reports become incredibly valuable tools for understanding businesses.</p>

                <p>Let me share the framework I've developed for reading these documents. I'm sure it'll evolve as I learn more, but this is what's working for me right now:</p>

                <p><strong>Step 1: Start with the business description.</strong> Usually in the first 10-20 pages, companies explain what they actually do. How do they make money? Who are their customers? What markets are they in? This isn't about numbers yet, it's about understanding the actual business. I ask myself: Could I explain this company's business model to someone else?</p>

                <p><strong>Step 2: Read the letter to shareholders.</strong> This is where the CEO or chairman talks directly to investors about how the year went, what challenges they faced, and what they're planning for the future. I read this skeptically (of course they're going to be optimistic), but it gives me insight into management's priorities and honesty.</p>

                <p><strong>Step 3: Look at the three main financial statements.</strong> Income statement (how much money did they make?), balance sheet (what do they own and owe?), and cash flow statement (where is cash actually flowing?). I won't lie, this part was intimidating at first. But I started by just looking at trends. Is revenue growing year over year? Is profit growing faster than revenue? Are they drowning in debt or managing it well?</p>

                <p>I made a lot of mistakes early on. I thought revenue was the same as profit (it's not, expenses matter a lot). I didn't understand why a company could be profitable but run out of cash (cash flow vs. accounting profit). I thought a high stock price meant a company was doing well (price is relative to value, not absolute).</p>

                <div class="quote-box">
                    "Every mistake I make reading financial statements is a lesson that sticks with me forever. I'm not afraid to be wrong right now while the stakes are low."
                </div>

                <p>What surprised me most? How much you can learn about a business just from how they spend their money. A company investing heavily in research and development is telling you they're focused on innovation. A company buying back tons of stock might be saying they can't find better uses for their cash, or that they think their stock is undervalued. A company taking on massive debt to fund acquisitions is making a very different bet than one growing organically.</p>

                <p>I'm still a complete beginner at financial analysis. There are analysts with decades of experience who dedicate their entire careers to this. But I'm not competing with them. I'm competing with the version of myself who knew nothing about this six months ago. And that guy would be pretty impressed with how far I've come.</p>

                <p>My advice to anyone else starting out? Pick a company you're genuinely interested in. Maybe you love their products, or you're curious about their industry. Download their latest annual report (they're all free on company websites). Don't try to understand everything at once. Just start reading. Look up terms you don't know. Take notes. Compare this year to last year. You'll be amazed at how quickly it starts to make sense.</p>

                <h3>Why I'm Learning About Index Funds Before Individual Stocks</h3>
                <div class="post-meta">Posted on January 25, 2026 | 7-minute read</div>
                
                <p>There's something really exciting about the idea of picking individual stocks. Finding that hidden gem that everyone else is overlooking. Buying Apple or Amazon before they become trillion-dollar companies. It's the dream, right?</p>

                <p>But the more I learn about investing, the more I realize that for most people, especially beginners like me, index funds are probably the smarter starting point. And I want to explain why, because this was a hard lesson for my ego to accept.</p>

                <p>An index fund is basically a basket of stocks that tracks a market index, like the S&P 500 (the 500 largest U.S. companies). When you buy an S&P 500 index fund, you're buying tiny pieces of Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and 496 other companies all at once. It's instant diversification.</p>

                <p>Here's what convinced me: study after study shows that most professional fund managers, people who do this for a living with teams of analysts and sophisticated tools, can't beat the market average over the long term. If they can't consistently pick winning stocks, what chance do I have as a 16-year-old with a laptop and access to Google?</p>

                <p>The data is pretty humbling. Over 15-year periods, around 90% of actively managed funds underperform their benchmark index. That's not because these fund managers are dumb, they're brilliant people. It's because the market is incredibly efficient. Good news about companies gets priced in almost immediately. Finding truly undervalued stocks that thousands of professional analysts have somehow missed is incredibly rare.</p>

                <div class="quote-box">
                    "I realized that accepting I'm not smarter than the market isn't giving up. It's being smart about my odds."
                </div>

                <p>Plus, index funds have crazy low fees. Some charge less than 0.05% per year. Meanwhile, actively managed funds might charge 1% or more. That difference sounds small, but over decades, it compounds into enormous amounts of money. If fees take 1% of your returns every year, you're potentially giving up hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime of investing.</p>

                <p>Does this mean I'll never buy individual stocks? Probably not. I'm still fascinated by analyzing companies and I think there's real value in learning how to evaluate businesses. But I'm planning to build my core portfolio with index funds and maybe experiment with a small portion in individual stocks as I learn more.</p>

                <p>The legendary investor Warren Buffett has said that most people should just invest in low-cost S&P 500 index funds. And this is a guy who's made tens of billions picking individual stocks. When someone at that level says index funds are the right move for most investors, I'm inclined to listen.</p>

                <p>I think there's wisdom in building a solid foundation first. Master the basics, understand market cycles, learn to control my emotions when markets drop, develop the discipline to invest consistently. Once I've proven I can do that with index funds, maybe then I'll have earned the right to try my hand at picking individual stocks.</p>

                <p>For now, I'm focused on learning, staying humble, and making sure I don't let my ambition override my common sense. The goal isn't to get rich quick. The goal is to build wealth steadily over decades, and index funds seem like the smartest path to get there.</p>

        <section id="journey" class="about-section" style="margin-top: 3rem;">
            <h2>My Learning Journey</h2>
            <p>I didn't grow up in a family of investors. My interest in finance started when I was 14 and randomly picked up a book about the stock market from my school library. I barely understood half of it, but something clicked. I wanted to know more.</p>

            <p>Since then, I've been consuming everything I can. Books by Benjamin Graham, Peter Lynch, and Morgan Housel. Podcasts about business and economics. YouTube channels that break down financial concepts. Annual reports from companies I find interesting. I spend my free time learning about things most teenagers couldn't care less about, and honestly? I love it.</p>

            <p>I'm documenting this journey because I wish resources like this existed when I started. Most investing content is either too dumbed down or written for people who already have degrees in finance. I want to create something in the middle, something that respects the reader's intelligence while acknowledging that we're all learning.</p>

            <p>I make mistakes. I misunderstand concepts and have to relearn them. I get excited about ideas that turn out to be flawed. That's all part of the process, and I'm not going to pretend otherwise. This blog is the real, unfiltered version of a teenager trying to figure out the world of finance.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="contact" class="about-section">
            <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
            <p>I'm always excited to connect with others who are interested in finance and investing, whether you're my age or decades ahead of me in your journey. If you have questions, want to share resources, or just want to discuss ideas, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
            <p>Remember: I'm not offering financial advice and I'm not an expert. But I am someone who's passionate about learning and happy to explore ideas together.</p>
